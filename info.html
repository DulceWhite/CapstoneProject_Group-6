                    Kentucky
                    that are at high risk. It is important that you prepare yourself in case such an emergency should

            <h1>Be Prepared</h1>
            <p>If you find that you are in a high risk area, there are important things you should consider to prepare
                your household in the event of a flood. The main four topics being your family, your pets, non-living
                essentials, and of course the home itself. </p>

            </div>
            <p>The most common suggestion to protect your home is to make sure you have flood insurance. Not all home
                insurance includes flood damage, and would be able to assist in any monetary belongings that may need to
                be replaced. Flood insurance can take up to 30 days before it takes effect. Be sure to be prepared
                before the emergency comes. For more information on insurance from FEMA, feel free to visit their <a
                    href="https://www.fema.gov/flood-insurance">Flood Insurance</a> page. If you find that your home is
                below the base flood elevation level, then you may want to invest in elevating your electrical
                components. If you have a basement, you can also seal the basement walls to prevent seepage. Also,
                installing a sump pump system will help drain water from your home.</p>

            <p>It is all too common that families find themselves in the grueling circles of customer service trying to
                replace important documents while rebuilding their lives from such an unexpectedly swift disaster.
                Knowing you are at high risk can make all of the difference for how an unfortunate disaster will effect
                your family. Having an elemental resistant storage container allows for a quick and easy pick up for all
                of the important things you may need. This may include everything from family and household records to
                money and irreplaceable pictures or memorabilia. We have found a number of styles you can choose from on

                <p>As adults it is difficult to find ourself unprepared in the situation of an emergency. If you have
                    dependants relying on you, it is even more stressful and even life-threatening if you are unsure of
                    what
                    to do. It is important that you are aware of your local emergency plans. Most counties will have an
                    emergency management department, but if you are unable to find that information, you are able to
                    search
                    your location on the FEMA website <a href="https://www.fema.gov/locations">here</a>.</p>
                <p>You also want to implement a family emergency plan. This plan will cater to your family's specific
                    needs.
                    Be sure to include a well known designated meeting spot, preferably easily accessible and higher
                    grounds. Each person should be assigned a task to ensure readiness. This could include which adult
                    handles any physically impaired family members, or who will grab the emergency folder. The family
                    emergency plan should be discussed and even put into practice regularly enough that everyone will be
                    prepared if necessary.</p>
                <p>Each person should also have an individual emergency bag. This bag can be any bag that is easy for
                    the
                    person to carry when filled, our go-to has been a book bag for years. An emergency bag should also
                    be
                    fairly personalized with a few general necessities.</p>

                <p>As a pet parent, I understand the concern for our fur-babies during an emergency. With that, it is
                    important to discuss pet readiness as well. In the event that you are unable to bring your pet during
                    evacuation, there are a few things that you can do to best care for your pet. If you must leave your pet
                    in the home, do not kennel or lock the pet into a specific room. Animals have instinctual knowledge for
                    survival and will likely do what they can to survive. Containing them to a specific area may prevent
                    them from escaping the flood. Placing a pet rescue decal on or around the front door of your home will
                    let first responders know that there may be a family pet within the home. If the pet is found, they will
                    be brought to the closest pet rescue facility to be cared for until their family if found. If you
                    previously have a chip placed in your pet by your vet, it will be easier for the staff to reunite you
                    with your pet. <br> If you are fully prepared to take your pet during evacuation, you may want to
                    prepare an emergency bag
                    for them as well. This back should include things like a storage bag of food, we use a gallon zip-lock,
                    holding about 6 cups of food. A pet first-aid kit, including gauze/non-stick bandages, adhesive or
                    medical tape, and hydrogen peroxide. A properly fitted collar with a non-retractable leash should either
                    be included or in use. Lastly, a small blanket for pets unable to maintain a regular body temperature.
                </p>

            <div>
                <div class="homeTitle">
                    <i class="fa-brands fa-opera"></i><h3>Leash and kennel safety.</h3><i class="fa-solid fa-igloo"></i>
                </div>
                <p>If you have a small pet that is easily carried, it is always best to keep them in a carrier/kennel to
                    ensure safe and swift evacuation. If your pet is too big to be carried, you should have them wear a
                    properly fitted collar to ensure that they do not "back-out" of it when scared. It is also important
                    that you use a non-retractable leash for multiple safety concerns. Most retractable leashes are easily
                    broken, mangled, or neglected making it difficult to control your pet in a stressful environment. It is
                    better to keep you pets close by with a manageable leash. </p>
